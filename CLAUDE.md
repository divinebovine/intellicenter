# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Guidelines

**IMPORTANT**: This repository is `joyfulhouse/intellicenter`. It was forked from upstream repositories, but we maintain our own independent development.

**NEVER submit pull requests to upstream repositories**:
- `https://github.com/dwradcliffe/intellicenter` (original upstream)
- `https://github.com/jlvaillant/intellicenter` (another fork)

All development, pull requests, and collaboration should happen within the `joyfulhouse/intellicenter` repository only.

## Project Overview

This is a Home Assistant custom integration for Pentair IntelliCenter pool control systems. It connects to IntelliCenter via local network (not cloud) using a custom TCP protocol on port 6681, supporting Zeroconf discovery and local push updates for real-time responsiveness.

**Current Quality Scale**: **Platinum** ✅ (v3.1.0+)

The integration meets **Platinum** quality scale requirements with:
- 257 automated tests across all platforms
- Comprehensive type annotations (mypy strict mode)
- Full code documentation
- Production hardening (circuit breaker, metrics, health monitoring)
- User-configurable options (keepalive, reconnect delay)
- External `pyintellicenter` library for protocol layer (https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pyintellicenter)

- **pyintellicenter**: TCP connection, protocol handling, model/PoolObject, discovery

### Publishing pyintellicenter to PyPI

When changes are made to pyintellicenter:

1. Bump version in `pyintellicenter/pyproject.toml`
2. Update requirement in `intellicenter/custom_components/intellicenter/manifest.json`
3. Commit and push pyintellicenter changes
4. Create a GitHub release to trigger the publish workflow:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bryanli/Projects/joyfulhouse/homeassistant-dev/pyintellicenter
   gh release create v0.0.X --title "v0.0.X" --notes "Release notes here"
   ```
5. Wait for publish workflow to complete (~60s)
6. Restart Home Assistant container to pick up new version

### Docker Development

The integration is volume-mounted to the homeassistant-dev container:
```bash
# Restart container after changes
cd /Users/bryanli/Projects/joyfulhouse/homeassistant-dev
docker compose restart homeassistant

# Check logs for intellicenter
docker compose logs --since 1m homeassistant 2>&1 | grep -i intellicenter

# Check installed pyintellicenter version
docker compose exec homeassistant pip show pyintellicenter | grep Version
```

## Development Commands

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run ruff linting with auto-fix
uv run ruff check --fix

# Format code with ruff
uv run ruff format

# Run type checking with mypy
uv run mypy custom_components/intellicenter/ --ignore-missing-imports

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Development Setup

The protocol layer is in a separate package (`pyintellicenter`). For development:

```bash
# Clone both repositories
git clone https://github.com/joyfulhouse/intellicenter.git
git clone https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pyintellicenter.git

# Install pyintellicenter in development mode
cd intellicenter
uv pip install -e ../pyintellicenter
```

### Testing

**Framework**: This project uses `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` for automated testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=custom_components/intellicenter --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_config_flow.py

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest -v
```

**Setting up tests**:
1. Install test dependencies: `pytest`, `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`, `pytest-asyncio`
2. Create `tests/` directory at repository root
3. Add `conftest.py` with required fixtures:
   ```python
   from pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common import MockConfigEntry

   # Enable custom integrations (required for HA 2021.6.0b0+)
   pytest_plugins = "pytest_homeassistant_custom_component"
   ```
4. Import test utilities using `from pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common import ...` instead of `from tests.common import ...`
5. Reference: https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component

**Manual testing** (still required for hardware-specific features):
1. A physical Pentair IntelliCenter system or access to one on the network
2. Installing the integration in a Home Assistant instance
3. Configuring via UI (config flow) or Zeroconf auto-discovery

**Writing tests**:
Tests should mock the TCP connection to IntelliCenter rather than requiring physical hardware. Key testing patterns:

```python
# Example config flow test structure
from pytest_homeassistant_custom_component.common import MockConfigEntry
from custom_components.intellicenter.const import DOMAIN

async def test_config_flow_user_step(hass):
    """Test user-initiated config flow."""
    # Mock BaseController.start() to return SystemInfo
    # Test UI form display, validation, entry creation

async def test_config_flow_zeroconf(hass):
    """Test Zeroconf discovery flow."""
    # Mock discovery_info, test auto-discovery logic

# Example platform test structure
async def test_light_entity_creation(hass):
    """Test light entities are created for pool lights."""
    # Create MockConfigEntry
    # Mock ModelController with test PoolObjects
    # Verify entities created with correct attributes

async def test_light_turn_on(hass):
    """Test turning on a pool light."""
    # Setup entity, call async_turn_on()
    # Verify requestChanges() called with correct params
```

Mock the protocol layer by patching `ModelController` or creating test `PoolModel` instances with fixture data. Avoid requiring actual IntelliCenter hardware.

## Architecture

### High-Level Structure

The integration follows a layered architecture:

1. **Home Assistant Layer** (`custom_components/intellicenter/`)
   - Platform modules: `light.py`, `sensor.py`, `switch.py`, `binary_sensor.py`, `water_heater.py`, `number.py`, `cover.py`
   - Entry point: `__init__.py` - Sets up integration, manages entity lifecycle
   - Config flow: `config_flow.py` - Handles UI setup, Zeroconf discovery, and options flow
   - Base entity: `PoolEntity` class in `__init__.py` - Common functionality for all entities
   - `PoolConnectionHandler` - Home Assistant integration bridge for connection events
   - `OnOffControlMixin` - Mixin for simple on/off entities

2. **Protocol/Model Layer** (`pyintellicenter` - external package)
   - Separate repository: https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pyintellicenter
   - Installed via `manifest.json` requirements: `pyintellicenter>=1.0.0`
   - `controller.py` - Controller classes:
     - `BaseController`: Basic TCP connection and command handling
     - `ModelController`: Manages PoolModel state and tracks attribute changes
     - `ConnectionHandler`: Reconnection logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker
     - `ConnectionMetrics`: Tracks response times, reconnect attempts, and health
   - `protocol.py` - `ICProtocol`: Low-level asyncio protocol using orjson, handles message framing, request queuing (one-at-a-time), and keepalive queries
   - `model.py` - `PoolModel` and `PoolObject`: Object model representing pool equipment
   - `attributes.py` - Attribute definitions and type mappings

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Connection Management**: The integration uses a layered approach to handle unreliable network connections:
- `ICProtocol` handles transport-level concerns (message framing, flow control, keepalive queries)
- `ModelController` manages state synchronization
- `ConnectionHandler` implements automatic reconnection with exponential backoff (configurable, default 30s)
- Circuit breaker pattern prevents hammering dead servers (opens after 5 failures)
- `ConnectionMetrics` tracks response times and reconnect attempts for observability

**State Updates**: Real-time updates flow through the system via:
1. IntelliCenter sends `NotifyList` messages when equipment state changes
2. `ModelController.receivedNotifyList()` updates the `PoolModel`
3. Dispatcher signals (`DOMAIN_UPDATE_{entry_id}`) notify Home Assistant entities
4. Entities call `async_write_ha_state()` to update HA

**Request Flow Control**: IntelliCenter struggles with concurrent requests, so `ICProtocol` enforces one request on the wire at a time using `_out_pending` counter and `_out_queue`.

### Entity Creation Logic

Entities are created based on equipment characteristics in the pool model:

- **Lights**: Created for circuits with subtypes `LIGHT`, `INTELLI`, `GLOW`, `GLOWT`, `DIMMER`, `MAGIC2`
  - Color effects only supported for `INTELLI`, `MAGIC2`, `GLOW` subtypes
- **Light Shows**: Created for circuits with subtype `LITSHO`
- **Switches**: Created for circuits marked as "Featured" (`FEATR_ATTR == "ON"`)
- **Bodies of Water**: Create switch, temperature sensors, and water heater entities
- **Pumps**: Create binary_sensor plus optional power/RPM/GPM sensors
- **Schedules**: Create binary_sensors (disabled by default)
- **IntelliChem**: Create pH, ORP, and tank level sensors

### Important Protocol Details

- **Message Format**: JSON over TCP (using orjson for 2-3x faster serialization), terminated with `\r\n`
- **Message IDs**: Auto-incremented integers for request/response correlation
- **Keepalive**: Protocol sends lightweight queries every 90 seconds (configurable), disconnects after 3 missed responses
- **Buffer Protection**: 1MB max buffer size to prevent DoS via malformed messages
- **Flow Control**: One request on wire at a time, with locked atomic operations and deadlock detection
- **Attribute Tracking**: Integration requests monitoring of specific attributes via `RequestParamList` command
  - Queries are batched to max 50 attributes to avoid choking the protocol
- **Temperature Units**: System supports METRIC/ENGLISH mode via `MODE_ATTR` on SYSTEM object

### Entity Naming and IDs

- `unique_id`: Combines `entry_id` + `objnam` + optional `attribute_key` (for multi-attribute entities)
- `name`: Defaults to `sname` from pool object, can be prefixed with "+" for suffix, or custom name
- All entities share a single device representing the IntelliCenter system

## Common Modifications

When adding support for new equipment types:
1. Add type/subtype constants to `attributes.py` if needed
2. Add to `attributes_map` in `__init__.py:async_setup_entry()` to specify tracked attributes
3. Create new platform module (e.g., `cover.py`) or extend existing one
4. Add platform to `PLATFORMS` list in `__init__.py`
5. Update `manifest.json` domains list and version
6. Implement entity creation logic in platform's `async_setup_entry()`

When modifying protocol handling:
- Be careful with request/response correlation - message IDs can mismatch on errors (IntelliCenter bug)
- Maintain one-request-at-a-time flow control in `ICProtocol`
- Handle both responses (with `response` field) and notifications (without `response` field)

## Configuration Files

- `manifest.json`: Integration metadata, version, dependencies, Zeroconf config
- `hacs.json`: HACS custom repository configuration
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Code quality tools configuration
- `strings.json`/`translations/en.json`: UI text for config flow

## Caveats and Limitations

- Only tested with original author's pool configuration - may not work with all equipment (chemistry, multiple heaters, cascades, etc.)
- Changing metric/English units while integration is running can cause incorrect values
- Recommended to reload integration after significant pool configuration changes
- Physical hardware testing recommended for new equipment types (automated tests cover protocol/logic)
- Use `uv` for dependency management
