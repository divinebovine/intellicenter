## What Does This Integration Do?

This integration connects your Pentair IntelliCenter pool control system to Home Assistant using a **100% local connection**. No cloud services, no internet dependency - just direct communication with your IntelliCenter over your local network.

- **Monitor Everything**: Pool/spa temperature, pump status, chemistry levels, heater activity
- **Control Your Pool**: Turn on lights, adjust heater setpoints, activate circuits, run light shows
- **Create Automations**: Schedule spa warmups, trigger party lighting, get freeze protection alerts
- **Real-time Updates**: Push-based notifications for instant state changes (no polling)

## Features

- **Local Connection**: Direct TCP communication on port 6681 - no cloud required
- **Automatic Discovery**: Zeroconf/mDNS discovers your IntelliCenter automatically
- **Real-time Updates**: Push-based notifications for instant state changes
- **Reliable Connection**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff and circuit breaker
- **Comprehensive Support**: Pools, spas, lights, pumps, heaters, chemistry, schedules, covers
- **Multi-Language**: User interface available in 12 languages

## Architecture

This integration is built on two separate packages:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[pyintellicenter](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pyintellicenter)** | Standalone Python library for IntelliCenter protocol ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyintellicenter/)) |
| **intellicenter** | Home Assistant integration (this repository) |

The protocol layer was extracted to `pyintellicenter` v0.1.0+ to enable:
- Independent development and testing of the protocol library
- Reuse in other projects outside Home Assistant
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## Prerequisites

Before installing this integration, you need:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Home Assistant** | Version **2025.11** or newer |
| **IntelliCenter** | i5P, i7P, i9P, or i10P panel |
| **Network** | Local network access to IntelliCenter (TCP port 6681) |

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories
2. Add URL: `https://github.com/joyfulhouse/intellicenter`
3. Category: Integration
4. Search for "Pentair IntelliCenter" and install
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

```bash
cd /config/custom_components
git clone https://github.com/joyfulhouse/intellicenter.git intellicenter
```

Restart Home Assistant after installation.

## Configuration

### Automatic Discovery

Your IntelliCenter should be discovered automatically:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Look for "Pentair IntelliCenter" under **Discovered**
3. Click **Configure** and confirm

### Manual Setup

If discovery doesn't work:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration** (bottom right)
3. Search for "Pentair IntelliCenter"
4. Enter your IntelliCenter's IP address

**Finding your IP address:**
- Router's DHCP client list (look for "Pentair")
- Pentair mobile app: Settings → System Information
- IntelliCenter display panel

> **Tip:** Assign a static IP or DHCP reservation to prevent address changes.

### Advanced Options

After setup, configure connection settings:

1. **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **IntelliCenter** → **Configure**
2. Available options:
   - **Keepalive Interval** (30-300s, default 90): Connection health check frequency
   - **Reconnect Delay** (10-120s, default 30): Initial retry delay after disconnect

## Automation Examples

### Evening Spa Warmup

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Evening Spa"
    trigger:
      - platform: sun
        event: sunset
        offset: "-00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.spa
      - service: water_heater.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: water_heater.spa
        data:
          temperature: 102
```

### Pool Party Lights

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Pool Party Mode"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.party_mode
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.pool_light
        data:
          effect: "Party"
```

### Freeze Protection Alert

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Freeze Protection Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.freeze_protection
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Pool Alert"
          message: "Freeze protection activated!"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Discovered

1. Ensure Home Assistant and IntelliCenter are on the same network/VLAN
2. Check that mDNS/multicast traffic isn't blocked by your router
3. Try manual setup with the IP address

### Connection Failed

1. Verify the IP address is correct
2. Test connectivity: `telnet <ip> 6681`
3. Check IntelliCenter is powered on and network cable connected
4. Try power cycling the IntelliCenter

### Entities Unavailable

1. Check connection status in **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Review logs: **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
3. Try reloading: **IntelliCenter** → **⋮** → **Reload**
4. The integration auto-reconnects with exponential backoff

### Enable Debug Logging

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.intellicenter: debug
    pyintellicenter: debug
```

## Known Limitations

- **Equipment Coverage**: Tested primarily with standard configurations. Some equipment may have limited testing.
- **Unit Changes**: Reload integration after changing metric/imperial on IntelliCenter.
- **Configuration Changes**: Reload integration after significant pool configuration changes.
