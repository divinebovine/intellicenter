## Highlights

- **100% Local** - Direct TCP connection to your IntelliCenter. No cloud, no internet required.
- **Real-time Updates** - Push-based notifications for instant state changes.
- **Zero Configuration** - Automatic discovery via Zeroconf/mDNS.
- **Reliable** - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff if connection drops.
- **Comprehensive** - Supports pools, spas, lights, pumps, heaters, chemistry, schedules, and more.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Home Assistant | 2023.1 or newer |
| IntelliCenter | i5P, i7P, i9P, or i10P |
| Network | Local network access (TCP port 6681) |

## Quick Start

### Installation via HACS (Recommended)

1. Open **HACS** → **Integrations** → **⋮** → **Custom repositories**
2. Add `https://github.com/joyfulhouse/intellicenter` (Category: Integration)
3. Search for "Pentair IntelliCenter" and click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant
5. Your IntelliCenter should be auto-discovered under **Settings** → **Devices & Services**

### Manual Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/intellicenter/releases)
2. Copy `custom_components/intellicenter` to your `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Automatic Discovery

Your IntelliCenter is automatically discovered via Zeroconf:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Look for "Pentair IntelliCenter" under **Discovered**
3. Click **Configure** and confirm

### Manual Setup

If discovery doesn't work:

1. **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **+ Add Integration**
2. Search for "Pentair IntelliCenter"
3. Enter your IntelliCenter's IP address

**Finding your IP address:**
- Router's DHCP client list (look for "Pentair")
- Pentair mobile app: **Settings** → **System Information**
- IntelliCenter display panel

> **Tip:** Assign a static IP or DHCP reservation to prevent address changes.

### Advanced Options

After setup, configure connection settings:

1. **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **IntelliCenter** → **Configure**
2. Adjust:
   - **Keepalive Interval** (30-300s, default 90) - Connection health check frequency
   - **Reconnect Delay** (10-120s, default 30) - Initial retry delay after disconnect

| **Circuits** | Switch | All "Featured" circuits (cleaner, blower, etc.) |
| **Pumps** | Binary Sensor, Sensors | Running status, power (W), speed (RPM), flow (GPM) |
| **Chemistry** | Sensors | pH, ORP, tank levels (IntelliChem) |
| **Heaters** | Binary Sensor | Running status |
| **Schedules** | Binary Sensor | Active status (disabled by default) |
| **System** | Switch, Binary Sensor, Sensors | Vacation mode, freeze protection, temperatures |

## Automation Examples

### Spa Ready at Sunset

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Evening Spa"
    trigger:
      - platform: sun
        event: sunset
        offset: "-00:30:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.spa
      - service: water_heater.set_temperature
        target:
          entity_id: water_heater.spa
        data:
          temperature: 102
```

### Pool Party Lights

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Pool Party Mode"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.party_mode
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.pool_light
        data:
          effect: "Party"
```

### Freeze Protection Alert

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Freeze Protection Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.freeze_protection
        to: "on"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Pool Alert"
          message: "Freeze protection activated!"
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Integration Not Discovered</strong></summary>

1. Ensure Home Assistant and IntelliCenter are on the same network/VLAN
2. Check that mDNS/multicast traffic isn't blocked
3. Try manual setup with the IP address
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Connection Failed</strong></summary>

1. Verify the IP address is correct
2. Ensure TCP port 6681 is accessible: `telnet <ip> 6681`
3. Check IntelliCenter is powered on and network cable connected
4. Try power cycling the IntelliCenter
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Entities Unavailable</strong></summary>

1. Check connection status in **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Review logs: **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**
3. Try reloading: **IntelliCenter** → **⋮** → **Reload**
4. The integration auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (30s, 45s, 67s...)
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Enable Debug Logging</strong></summary>

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.intellicenter: debug
```
</details>

## Architecture

This integration is built on two packages:

| Package | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [pyintellicenter](https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pyintellicenter) | Standalone Python library for IntelliCenter protocol |
| intellicenter | Home Assistant integration using pyintellicenter |

The separation allows the protocol library to be used in other projects and simplifies testing.

## Development

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/joyfulhouse/intellicenter.git
cd intellicenter
uv sync

# For simultaneous pyintellicenter development
git clone https://github.com/joyfulhouse/pyintellicenter.git ../pyintellicenter
uv pip install -e ../pyintellicenter

# Testing
uv run pytest                    # Run tests
uv run pytest --cov              # With coverage
uv run ruff check --fix          # Lint
uv run ruff format               # Format
```

See [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) for full development guidelines.

## Known Limitations

- **Equipment Coverage** - Tested primarily with standard configurations. Some equipment (covers, cascades, multiple heaters) may have limited testing.
- **Unit Changes** - Reload integration after changing metric/imperial on IntelliCenter.
- **Configuration Changes** - Reload integration after significant pool configuration changes.
